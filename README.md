## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ana Beatriz Marcondes. I am from Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo and I'm majoring in Pedagogy (Education)

I have a great interest in data analysis and project management, but during my studies of Python I discovered a great universe of possibilities. Now, I want to explore everything I can do with what I have learned so far.

I have studied Power BI, SQL, and Python extensively for data analysis.
